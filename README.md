# Home-Automation-Major-Project-
This project demonstrates a smart home automation system built with NodeMCU ESP8266, relays, and sensors to control and monitor home appliances remotely. Sensor data (temperature, humidity, motion, smoke) is collected in real time and transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud server for storage, visualization, and analysis.
