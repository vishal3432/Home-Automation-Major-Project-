# 🏠 Home Automation Major Project  

This project proposes an efficient implementation of **IoT (Internet of Things)** for monitoring and controlling home appliances via the **World Wide Web**. The system enables remote access to lights, fans, and door locks through a smartphone-based **web interface**, with communication facilitated by **Wi-Fi** and **Raspberry Pi** as the server system.
