# 🏠 Home Automation Major Project  

This project proposes an efficient implementation of **IoT (Internet of Things)** for monitoring and controlling home appliances via the **World Wide Web**. The system enables remote access to lights, fans, and door locks through a smartphone-based **web interface**, with communication facilitated by **Wi-Fi** and **Raspberry Pi** as the server system.

## 🔑 Highlights of the Project  
- ✅ Touch switch–based lighting  
- ✅ Mobile-operated lighting system  
- ✅ Visitor counter–based lighting system  
- ✅ Automated street lighting system  
- ✅ LPG leakage detection system  
- ✅ Fire alert system  
- ✅ IoT-based data monitoring system
