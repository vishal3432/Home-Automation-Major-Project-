# 🏠 Home Automation Major Project  

This project proposes an efficient implementation of **IoT (Internet of Things)** for monitoring and controlling home appliances via the **World Wide Web**. The system enables remote access to lights, fans, and door locks through a smartphone-based **web interface**, with communication facilitated by **Wi-Fi** and **Raspberry Pi** as the server system.  

An additional safety feature includes **smoke detection**, which triggers an alert message in case of a fire accident. Even if the internet connection is down, the system continues to operate appliances locally using the embedded board.  

Overall, the solution is **scalable** and **cost-effective**, ensuring both convenience and safety.

## 🏗 IoT Architecture  

The IoT architecture used in this project follows **four layers**:  

1. **IoT Device Layer** – Client-side (sensors & actuators)  
2. **IoT Gateway Layer** – Server-side operators  
3. **IoT Platform Layer** – Pathway connecting clients and operators  
4. **Application Layer** – Data processing and interaction with data centers  

### 🔹 Four Stages of IoT System
- **Stage 1:** Sensors & actuators  
- **Stage 2:** Aggregation systems & ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)  
- **Stage 3:** Data processing with suitable technology  
- **Stage 4:** Data collection in data centers
